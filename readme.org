* Eyesore PHP/httpd docker container

This is docker container running both httpd (apache2) and php-fpm.

The webserver is configured to serve PHP through php-fpm by default, and can be further extended by mounting configs into ~/usr/local/apache2/conf/conf.d~.

The default webroot is ~/var/www/app~
If your application contains PHP outside the webroot, you may define an alternate webroot and mount the configuration into the above directory.

** Usage

~docker pull eyesore/php-dev:latest~ for latest

Available tags:

1. 5.6
2. 7.4
3. 8.1

** Composer

Composer is available as a binary (~/usr/local/bin/composer~) in this image.

Example usage:

#+begin_src bash
  docker run --rm -ti \
	   --entrypoint /usr/local/bin/composer \
	   -v $(pwd):/app \
	   --user $(id -u):$(id -g) \
	   eyesore/php-dev install
#+end_src
