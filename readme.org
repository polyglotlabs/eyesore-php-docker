* Eyesore PHP/httpd docker container

This is docker container running both httpd (apache2) and php-fpm.

The webserver is configured to serve PHP through php-fpm by default, and can be further extended by mounting configs into ~/usr/local/apache2/conf/conf.d~.

The default webroot is ~/var/www/app~
If your application contains PHP outside the webroot, you may define an alternate webroot and mount the configuration into the above directory.
